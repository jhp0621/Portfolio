        <h1>Kite Games</h1>
        <p>
          Kite is a multiplayer realtime games website built within 2.5 weeks by a
          team of 3 developers. As social distancing quickly became the norm, we
          were inspired to create a virtual space where friends can relax and
          enjoy each other's company without having to be in the same room.
          <br /> Similar to Jackbox.Tv, users on Kite.games can host or join a game through a shared code and play classic party games such as 'Fess
          up' (also known as Never Have I Ever), Drawing a Blank' (Picktionary), and 'Rope Dude' (Hangman). They can use the chat to communicate (#gg)
          and send direct invites to the players they recently played with.
          <br /> My contributions for the project include: building a variety of components and utility functions for games; setting up user authentication & OAuth; using Cloudinary and
          Signature Canvas for image processing; and implementing sound effects for games,
          chats, and notifications.
          <br /> Built with: React, Firebase realtime DB, Express, Bootstrap, Cloudinary, React Signature Canvas, UIfx

        It's not only writers who can benefit from this free online tool. If
        you're a programmer who's working on a project where blocks of text are
        needed, this tool can be a great way to get that. It's a good way to
        test your programming and that the tool being created is working well.
        Above are a few examples of how the random paragraph generator can be
        beneficial. The best way to see if this random paragraph picker will be
        useful for your intended purposes is to give it a try. Generate a number
        of paragraphs to see if they are beneficial to your current project. If
        you do find this paragraph tool useful, please do us a favor and let us
        know how you're using it. It's greatly beneficial for us to know the
        different ways this tool is being used so we can improve it with
        updates. This is especially true since there are times when the
        generators we create get used in completely unanticipated ways from when
        we initially created them. If you have the time, please send us a quick
        note on what you'd like to see changed or added to make it better in the
        future.
